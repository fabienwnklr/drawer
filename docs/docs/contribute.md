## I have a question

there is no stupid question, only silly answers (but still check that the answer does not already exist...).

if you have any question, the [discussion](https://github.com/fabwcie/drawer/discussions) is here for that ! so don't hesitate.

## Reporting bugs

Please follow some step before report a bug

- Make sure that you are using the latest version.
- Determine if your bug is a bug and not an error. e.g., using incompatible environment components/versions (Make sure that you have read the documentation. If you are looking for support, you might want to check [this section](#i-have-a-question)).
- To see if other users have experienced (and potentially already solved) the same issue you are having, check if there is not already a bug report existing for your bug or error in [the bug tracker](https://github.com/fabwcie/drawer/issues).
- Make sure to search the internet (including Stack Overflow) to see if users outside the GitHub community have discussed the issue.
- Collect information about the bug:
    - Stack trace (Traceback)
    - OS, Platform, and Version (Windows, Linux, macOS, x86, ARM)
    - Version of the interpreter, compiler, SDK, runtime environment, and package manager, depending on what seems relevant.
- Possibly your input and the output
- Can you reliably reproduce the issue?
    - Can you also reproduce it with older versions? Or have you updated to the latest version?
